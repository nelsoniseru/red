This project was built with nodejs express and mongodb database.

# first step
create an env folder in the same folder your frontend file and backend file is add a port number in your env folder and also add a mongodb connection string and also the coinlayer key from your coinlayer account because this project uses the coinlayer api for the exchange rates
# second step
create a env file in the front end folder to add a url that contains the port you have configured e.g http://localhost:4000 this is the url that helps you connect to the backend note that it is added with a prefix  REACT_APP eg REACT_APP_BASE_URL = http://localhost:4000 
# third step
Then go to your terminal and run this command "npm install" to install all the dependecies for your backend 
# fourth step
cd into frontend folder with the command "cd frontend" and run npm install to install the dependencies for the front end 
# fifth step
Then one step backwards with the command "cd.." after that run this command "npm run dev" to spin the frontend and backend server simultaneously
